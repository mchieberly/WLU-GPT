That number depends on the number of students who join the waiting list by registering in the Applicant Portal. If we do not hear from you, we'll assume that you've chosen to attend another school. Typically around 600-700 students join our waiting list. We don't rank our waiting list. If we end up with unfilled spaces in the class, we will reevaluate our needs at that point and admit students who meet these needs. No two years are exactly alike when it comes to how the waiting list process goes. In past years the number has ranged from as few as zero to as many as 40 students. But you cannot be admitted to W&L from the waiting list if you do not register in the Applicant Portal. There is a chance you will hear from us in late April, but most likely you will not hear from us until after May 1, which is the deadline for admitted students to reserve their places in the class. In the meantime, you should make plans to attend another college and reserve your place in its first-year class, since we cannot assure you that we'll admit any students from our waiting list. We sound like a broken record, but we will only consider your application further if you communicate your desire to join our waiting list by registering for it through your account in the Applicant Portal. Also, stay in touch with us over the coming weeks. Keep us informed of any changes to your record (awards you've won, grades you've earned, etc.), and feel free to communicate to us the depth of your interest in attending W&L. If we end up with room for more students, we will review your application again, and updates can be very helpful as we consider it further.

As this is a growing project and responsibility, we encourage feedback. Let us know what content doesn\u2019t work for you or what you would like to see added to the site by contacting Steve Mammarella, Web Accessibility Coordinator (mammarellas@wlu.edu). What is Web Accessibility? Simply put, it means making your site available to the widest possible audience. There are many reasons to make your online resource accessible. Both the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibit colleges and universities from discriminating against students, faculty, and staff with disabilities. But the most important reason is this: web accessibility is the right thing to do. People with disabilities are attempting to read your content and you should do everything you can to help. When using this website to implement accessibility for your website, you should be aware of the following: Priority should be given to new and revised website development when implementing accessibility. This doesn\u2019t mean that you can ignore existing online resources that are necessary for participation in the University community, but it is more effective to implement accessibility from the inception of a web project than to do so retroactively. The best practices detailed on this site are based on the de facto standards of the World Wide Web Consortium\u2019s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0). Section 508 guidelines are currently being revised to align with WCAG 2.0. Some third-party vendors may still be validating against WCAG 1.0, and you may need to evaluate their interfaces with the W3C WCAG 1.0 Checklist. Many vendors doing extensive work for the federal government follow Section 508 standards, and you can use the Section 508 checklist in such cases.

Because the world in which we live is so diverse and interconnected, our mission is to empower students to examine their own lives and values in the context of many different societies, including our own, to develop understandings of cultural variation. In teaching about what it means to be human, we offer a variety of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies through which students learn about social interaction and cultural practices. Our students acquire advanced skills of critical thinking, precise writing, and well-informed interaction with diverse communities. These abilities are extraordinarily helpful in a variety of career choices, including business, law, the health professions, and graduate school. Feature Stories Loading...
