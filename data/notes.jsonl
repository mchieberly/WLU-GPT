That number depends on the number of students who join the waiting list by registering in the Applicant Portal. If we do not hear from you, we'll assume that you've chosen to attend another school. Typically around 600-700 students join our waiting list. We don't rank our waiting list. If we end up with unfilled spaces in the class, we will reevaluate our needs at that point and admit students who meet these needs. No two years are exactly alike when it comes to how the waiting list process goes. In past years the number has ranged from as few as zero to as many as 40 students. But you cannot be admitted to W&L from the waiting list if you do not register in the Applicant Portal. There is a chance you will hear from us in late April, but most likely you will not hear from us until after May 1, which is the deadline for admitted students to reserve their places in the class. In the meantime, you should make plans to attend another college and reserve your place in its first-year class, since we cannot assure you that we'll admit any students from our waiting list. We sound like a broken record, but we will only consider your application further if you communicate your desire to join our waiting list by registering for it through your account in the Applicant Portal. Also, stay in touch with us over the coming weeks. Keep us informed of any changes to your record (awards you've won, grades you've earned, etc.), and feel free to communicate to us the depth of your interest in attending W&L. If we end up with room for more students, we will review your application again, and updates can be very helpful as we consider it further.

As this is a growing project and responsibility, we encourage feedback. Let us know what content doesn\u2019t work for you or what you would like to see added to the site by contacting Steve Mammarella, Web Accessibility Coordinator (mammarellas@wlu.edu). What is Web Accessibility? Simply put, it means making your site available to the widest possible audience. There are many reasons to make your online resource accessible. Both the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibit colleges and universities from discriminating against students, faculty, and staff with disabilities. But the most important reason is this: web accessibility is the right thing to do. People with disabilities are attempting to read your content and you should do everything you can to help. When using this website to implement accessibility for your website, you should be aware of the following: Priority should be given to new and revised website development when implementing accessibility. This doesn\u2019t mean that you can ignore existing online resources that are necessary for participation in the University community, but it is more effective to implement accessibility from the inception of a web project than to do so retroactively. The best practices detailed on this site are based on the de facto standards of the World Wide Web Consortium\u2019s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0). Section 508 guidelines are currently being revised to align with WCAG 2.0. Some third-party vendors may still be validating against WCAG 1.0, and you may need to evaluate their interfaces with the W3C WCAG 1.0 Checklist. Many vendors doing extensive work for the federal government follow Section 508 standards, and you can use the Section 508 checklist in such cases.

{"note": "Chemistry and Biochemistry Department About the Department Faculty and Staff Research Groups Facilities and Equipment Opportunities for Students Health Professions The Science Library Chemistry and Biochemistry Academic Division:\nThe College Degrees Offered:\nBachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science Academic Programs:\nChemistry Major Course Offerings:\n\n Fall\n\n Winter\n\n Spring Mission Statement We in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at W&L provide education in the chemical sciences, conduct scientific research in chemistry, biochemistry, and related areas, and share expertise and service to other members of the Washington and Lee community as well as a wide range of professional and private communities outside of W&L. Our Pedagogical Goals We have as our primary pedagogical goals both to instill in our students understanding of chemistry based in current chemical knowledge, and the desire to continue the pursuit of a deeper or broader understanding of chemistry in particular, and knowledge in general. We are committed to preparing life-long learners who are equipped with skills derived in our classrooms and laboratories. Our Learning Objectives Upon completing a major in chemistry or biochemistry, our students will understand essential chemical principles and have a foundation of factual chemical knowledge on which they may build in the future. Our students will develop intellectual skills that they may use to solve problems in chemistry and beyond. Our students will learn to use the chemical literature and learn to communicate scientific results both orally and in writing. Our students will have the opportunity to develop a wide range of technical skills as a result of working with modern laboratory technology, while simultaneously developing basic competence in laboratory techniques, skills, practices, including basic laboratory safety skills. Finally, our students will learn to work as part of a team and understand ethical practices in chemistry. Our Students We serve students with varied interests. These students include, but are not restricted to: those pursuing careers in the chemical sciences directly upon graduation or after further studies; those pursuing careers in the Health Professions; those pursuing careers in branches of the natural sciences other than chemistry; and those who will study chemistry as part of W&L's Foundations and Distribution requirements or for purposes of scientific literacy. Our Research and Service We are committed to an environment that is conducive to the pursuit and practice of scientific research in chemistry and related fields. This research contributes to faculty development and it provides exposure for students in the role and practice of the scientific method. Our Department makes its expertise in the chemical sciences available to others in the University and larger community as needed. Members of the Chemistry Department serve as student advisors and on University committees. Learning Objectives Discover more details concerning learning objectives specific to individual courses.

It offers a full four-year program of language courses in both Chinese and Japanese, as well as literature and culture courses in English. The language courses are designed to develop advanced communication skills in Japanese and Chinese through intensive language training and to provide a foundation for understanding the cultural traditions of China and Japan. The literature in translation courses aim to foster an awareness and understanding of East Asian cultures through an Interdisciplinary approach, introducing historical background, social, philosophical, political issues, and other cultural concerns relevant and necessary to the understanding of the literary and other cultural texts. The department's curricula provide solid disciplinary training, preparing students to meet the challenges in further graduate studies or in career development. The department stresses close interactions between students and the faculty. Diverse East Asian cultural activities such as A Taste of Asia and the Lunar New Year Celebration give students opportunities to practice their language skills outside the classroom in a relaxed, social setting. The department also sponsors spring term study abroad programs to China and Japan, where students are not only engaged in immersion language learning, but also in studying East Asian cultures through close contacts with their peoples. Furthermore, EALL majors are encouraged to spend a summer, a semester or a year studying abroad in China and Japan to enhance their proficiency in language and to broaden their knowledge of the East Asian cultures. Thanks to our increasing alumni support, each year the department awards The Andrew M. Hemm Prize of Excellence to two students with the highest average grades during their first two years of Chinese and Japanese studies respectively. In addition, the department also offers The James Boardman Study Abroad Scholarships to two students preparing to study abroad. Our Students and Alumni Loading...

Make Your Gift Today  21st Century Learning Huntley Hall Renovation and Williams School Expansion Washington and Lee\u2019s Williams School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics stands out among the top 20 liberal arts institutions as the only internationally accredited undergraduate business program. The number of students majoring in accounting, business administration, economics, and politics at W&L has grown significantly over the last 20 years, with nearly 50 percent of each graduating class earning degrees in one of these disciplines. To accommodate that growth and to provide a modern learning complex that supports this robust program, W&L plans to renovate Huntley Hall and build a new Williams School structure on Washington Street. These improvements will facilitate hands-on learning, accommodate the university\u2019s hallmark small class size, and enhance networking and professional development opportunities for students.

Stop API Hate Since March of 2020 the number of reported hate/bias incidents against Asian and Pacific Islander (API) people has increased exponentially. However, we cannot truly quantify the number of hate/bias incidents as many incidents go unreported. Members of the API community at W&L encourage you to stand up and speak out to #StopAPIHate.

RTEC is a partnership between Washington and Lee University and Southern Virginia University. The value and advantages of the Consortium rest on several factors: proximity and program identity opportunities for a richer program through institutional collaboration ability to meet licensure areas where teacher shortages exist professional development and partnering with local schools Collaboration among the two schools offers a number of strengths. It supplements the capacity of both education departments to create a robust program that offers more courses, more frequently. Because of the consortium, students will be better positioned to schedule and take the courses they need to complete their licensure requirements. Clearly, one of the major strengths of this collaboration is the diversity of knowledge, skills and values in the two teacher education departments that complement and reinforce each other. While each shares a common perspective as small liberal arts colleges, each also has a unique mission and attracts students with different interests and backgrounds. The consortium recognizes the complexity this generates, but values the opportunity for students to engage in a collaborative program where they can learn from each other. This collaborative structure produces a critical mass of diverse students for each education course that enriches class discussions and collaborative projects. Feature Stories Loading...

Can dramatic depictions of both wellness and illness catalyze us to think about how to better care for ourselves and others? Using the WHO's definition of health as a \"state of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity,\" we will think not only about how works of art dramatize these concepts, but also what they mean in our own lives and in the lives of those in our community. Students will have their choice of an experiential learning component, either through a community-based learning volunteer placement or through researching and designing a wellness or self-care initiative for peers.

HIST 105\u00a0-\u00a0Scenes from Chinese HistoryFDRHU Humanities DistributionCredits3Film is one of the 20th century's most influential forms of mass communication and, consequently, has been one medium for the creation and maintenance of nation-states. In this sense, no film can be considered as mere entertainment entirely divorced from the social, political, economic and, ultimately, historical context in which it was produced. This is particularly true of modern nation-states invented during the 20th century like the People's Republic of China (PRC). This course is intended to explore how contemporary PRC cinema has interpreted Chinese history, as represented by some of that history's pre-PRC milestones of conflict in the Qin and Qing dynasties as well as the Republican period. Students evaluate the films critically as historical products of their own times as well as current historical narratives of the past by examining each event through a pair of films produced at different times in PRC history. Students also examine post-1949 changes in China and its interpretation of its pre-1949 history, and so, by seeing how a country interprets its history at a given time.

For some students the requirement to specialize in a major presents problems when their interests do not fit into an already-established major program. For those students, the independent work major has been created. The following requirements and guidelines should be used in preparing your proposal for such a major. Requirements You must be in good standing, i.e. not on academic probation. Your independent work major must be your only major. Applications for independent work as one of multiple majors will not be accepted. (If you meet the requirements for an already-established major, your choice of electives can shape whatever secondary interest you have.) You must prepare a clear and coherent plan of study in consultation with the Associate Dean of The College and at least two faculty members from different disciplines who are willing to support your proposal and to serve as your advisers. You should submit your proposal to the Committee on Courses and Degrees sometime prior to the end of your sophomore year. Your proposal must be submitted before October 15th of your junior year. Once your proposal is approved, any subsequent changes (e.g., course substitutions) must be approved by the Committee on Courses and Degrees. Guidelines for Preparing the Proposal Your proposal must be a clear and coherent statement demonstrating benefits not obtainable in an already-established major. Please include the following: Background research: How did you conceive this program? What other schools with similar majors have you consulted? What graduate programs have you contacted as to their expectations? What W&L faculty have you worked with? Reasons for the major: What arguments can you present as to why this program of study will be more beneficial to you than an already-established major? Courses in the major: List every course you will include in the program and comment on how it will contribute to the overall major. Distribution of courses: Your major should have the same logic in its structure as other W&L programs. You should have a few 100-level courses but not many, and a majority of 200-and 300-level courses. You should include some sort of \"capstone\" activity such as a senior thesis or research paper, giving you an opportunity to synthesize approaches from the various disciplines. Projected schedule: Because some courses are not taught during faculty sabbaticals or for other reasons, we recommend you use the projected schedule form to get the approval of the appropriate department heads for each course being taught during the term you plan to take it. Remember, subsequent changes must be approved by the Committee on Courses and Degrees. Use the form here to gain approvals form the respective department heads for a schedule of relevant course offerings. Adviser approvals: You must include letters of support for your proposal from each of your sponsoring advisers. NB: Well-prepared examples of other independent major proposals are kept on file in the office of the Dean of The College. Feel free to consult these examples as models for your own proposal.

It offers a full four-year program of language courses in both Chinese and Japanese, as well as literature and culture courses in English. The language courses are designed to develop advanced communication skills in Japanese and Chinese through intensive language training and to provide a foundation for understanding the cultural traditions of China and Japan. The literature in translation courses aim to foster an awareness and understanding of East Asian cultures through an Interdisciplinary approach, introducing historical background, social, philosophical, political issues, and other cultural concerns relevant and necessary to the understanding of the literary and other cultural texts. The department's curricula provide solid disciplinary training, preparing students to meet the challenges in further graduate studies or in career development. The department stresses close interactions between students and the faculty. Diverse East Asian cultural activities such as A Taste of Asia and the Lunar New Year Celebration give students opportunities to practice their language skills outside the classroom in a relaxed, social setting. The department also sponsors spring term study abroad programs to China and Japan, where students are not only engaged in immersion language learning, but also in studying East Asian cultures through close contacts with their peoples. Furthermore, EALL majors are encouraged to spend a summer, a semester or a year studying abroad in China and Japan to enhance their proficiency in language and to broaden their knowledge of the East Asian cultures. Thanks to our increasing alumni support, each year the department awards The Andrew M. Hemm Prize of Excellence to two students with the highest average grades during their first two years of Chinese and Japanese studies respectively. In addition, the department also offers The James Boardman Study Abroad Scholarships to two students preparing to study abroad. Our Students and Alumni Loading...

Because W&L is a member of Sunoikisis, a collaborative virtual Classics Department sponsored by the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington D.C., our faculty and advanced students may participate in the courses, conferences, archaeological expeditions, and other opportunities offered by this consortium. All collaborative courses are taught on campus by W&L faculty with the additional advantage of weekly online guest lectures and discussions with students and faculty from other participating colleges. For further information, click the link above or contact a faculty member. We are a member of Eta Sigma Phi, the national collegiate Honor Society for students of Classics. Students who have formally declared Classics as a major, who have achieved a GPA of 3.7 or higher in the major, and 3.5 or higher overall, and who have successfully completed at least one course at the 300 level in either Latin or Greek may be recommended by the Classics faculty for membership. Invitations are issued at the end of winter term. Members of Eta Sigma Phi are eligible to apply for a variety of opportunities including prizes and scholarship support.

Research Driven.United to Predict What's News Rewatch the Convention Livestream 2024 Republican Nominee Prediction Republican Party Platform  Who We Are years of tradition, to this day Mock Convention continues to be an entirely student-run organization. By Convention Weekend in February 2024, over 95 percent of the student body will be involved in Mock Con in some way. With over 1,500 positions, there is a place for everyone from political junkies to art majors and everyone in between. The Convention Convention Weekend is the culmination of years of preparation and research. Aiming to accurately replicate the Nominating Convention of the party out-of-power in the White House, the 2024 Cycle is a Republican one. Today, Convention Weekend includes a parade through downtown Lexington, world-class speakers, but most importantly, the nominee prediction. Fifty-seven student state delegations draw from the latest polling data, the insights of analysts, and the acumen of on-the-ground contacts in each constituency to predict the distribution of delegates for their states and territories. Speakers Mock Convention is committed to bringing world class speakers to the W&L campus. From Presidents to journalists to activists, in 2024 we commit to accurately portray the range of the Republican Party. In 115 years we have had quite the list of speakers, including five presidents. Below, you can find some of our most notable speakers, including our first keynote speaker, William Jennings Bryan, and our most recent, Trevor Noah. Research At its core, Mock Convention is a political research project. We aim not only to accurately predict the 2024 Republican nomineee, but to unify the Washington and Lee Campus as well. While Mock Convention holds the title of being the most accurate mock national convention in the country, with 74% accuracy, being united in our prediction is what makes our legacy even greater.

While the University has an excellent record of placing these prospective candidates into the professional schools, the fact is that not all prospective candidates will be able to secure positions in a professional school of their primary career choice. For this reason, pre-health professional candidates should carefully plan their undergraduate academic program, leaving open the widest possible range of options. On the following pages, we provide the best advice and information available to help you make choices during your undergraduate career. Competition for acceptance to health professional graduate schools is fierce, so take every opportunity to enhance your chances. Planning should begin in your freshman year with the advice of a faculty member experienced in advising health career students.

{"note": "Cognitive and Behavioral Science About the Department Faculty and Staff CBSC Student Research Careers in Cognitive and Behavioral Science CBSC-relevant internships, 2024 Resources for Students Cognitive and Behavioral Science (formerly Psychology) Academic Division:\nThe College Degrees Offered:\nBachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science Academic Programs:\nCognitive and Behavioral Science Major Course Offerings:\n\n Fall\n\n Winter\n\n Spring Our field lies at an intersection of sciences.\u00a0 It is informed by, and informs, the natural and behavioral sciences in equal measure. It is a broad field that investigates mechanisms that underlie a wide range of mental processes and behaviors. Researchers are interested in all of the interacting psychological functions - cognitive, affective, behavioral, physiological, social, developmental - that drive and define the human experience. In recent years, the general structure of science has been mapped through analysis of citation data from natural and social sciences journals. The purpose of this work is to illuminate patterns of scientific influence within and among the sciences. Cognitive and Behavioral Science, along with mathematics, physics, chemistry, earth sciences, medicine and the social sciences, has been identified as one of seven major hub sciences. The hub sciences generate research with high rates of citation by scientists across many other fields. It can be helpful to conceptualize the field of Cognitive and Behavioral Science in these ways. Its dendrites and axons reach across disciplinary boundaries. It is an integrative scientific field with multidisciplinary foundations, rich linkages to other sciences, and applications within diverse career paths. If it is appealing to position your academic life in such intersections, Cognitive and Behavioral Science may be the major for you. The W&L Cognitive and Behavioral Science curriculum encourages individualization of the major in several ways: First, students may choose to earn a B.A. or a B.S. degree. The B.A. tends to be a good fit for students who are interested in the breadth that our major has to offer, including the applications of this science to multiple disciplines and career paths. The B.S. works well for students who are particularly interested in studying Cognitive and Behavioral Science in the context of, or in interaction with, other STEM fields. Both the B.A. and B.S. paths provide excellent preparation for students who may pursue graduate school in psychology or other research disciplines. Second, a majority of our students choose to join a faculty member's research team. This team experience provides majors with a close-knit academic home on campus and allows them to spread their wings in a professional research context. Some lab members, especially those who are selected as W&L Summer Research Scholars, have the opportunity to become credentialed in research by presenting the lab's findings at a professional conference and/or earning authorship on a published article. Finally, majors choose an advanced methods course\u00a0that fits your interest. Design a study or intervention, test participants, analyze data, and create work that could be presented at a conference or submitted for publication. All W&L Cognitive and Behavioral Science majors graduate with considerable research experience and a strong foundation in research design, data analysis, technological skills and professionalism. This is because we know that in the process of conducting research, our majors develop a skill set that is essential to any future professional path they will choose. Research requires skill in organization, problem-solving, collaboration and data analysis. Faculty members in the W&L Cognitive and Behavioral Science Department invest in helping each major to develop these durable skills in our classrooms and labs. Our Students Loading... News Loading...

{"note": "Medieval and Renaissance Studies Program About the Program Course Offerings Faculty and Staff Student Resources Announcements Medieval and Renaissance Studies Program Academic Division:\nThe College Academic Programs:\nMajor Requirements\nMinor Requirements Course Offerings:\n\n Fall\n\n Winter\n\n Spring At the turn of the twentieth century the diplomat and scholar Henry Adams set out to explain to his fellow Americans what the massive island fortress monastery of Mont Saint Michel meant to its eleventh century Norman builders. To do this he turned to literature, history, theology, studies of migration patterns, warfare, and the economics of medieval manorial land holding. Like Adams, students in Washington and Lee\u2019s Medieval and Renaissance Studies major approach European culture in an interdisciplinary way. They study the materials of many disciplines, examining them from different perspectives using diverse methods. Courses in traditional fields of study \u2013 like art history, religion, history, literature, musicology, philosophy, political theory, economics, and even astronomy \u2013 combine to form a comprehensive program whereby an entire culture can be encountered on a variety of levels. The program offers over sixty courses organized into four broad categories. Students concentrate their studies in one or two fields, but take courses in other areas as well, allowing them to receive a well-rounded and broadly-based understanding of a profoundly complex period. Many choose to do Honors in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, and many do part of their course work while studying abroad. Medieval and Renaissance Studies majors go on to careers in law, academics, medicine, teaching, museum curatorship, government service and business.

{"note": "The Sciences at W&L Formal Sciences Life Sciences Physical Sciences Interdisciplinary Programs Student Opportunities Careers in Science Science Facilities Antique Scientific Equipment Exhibit Science Advisory Board The Sciences at W&L The term \"science\" commonly refers to a set of methods of investigation leading to knowledge of the natural world. These methods include systematic observation, the formation of hypotheses and theories, and the construction of experiments to test these theories and hypotheses. Washington and Lee offers curriculum and majors from all three areas of scientific study: Formal Sciences, Life Sciences and Physical Science. The\u00a0formal sciences study the symbol systems used to express ideas in the other sciences and to express ideas about these symbol systems themselves. The\u00a0life sciences are concerned with the study of living organisms, including human beings, and the manner in which they interact with their natural environments. The\u00a0physical sciences investigate the underlying materials and processes of the universe, ranging from the subatomic to the intergalactic. Close and supportive student-faculty relationships Abundant opportunities and funds for student research guided by PhD faculty Excellent facilities Successful placement in top graduate and professional programs In short, many of the benefits of studying at larger institutions with the added strength of far more individual attention and assistance. A \"formal science\" is an area of study that uses formal systems to generate knowledge such as in Mathematics and Computer Science.  Formal sciences are important subjects because all of quantitative science depends on them. Life Sciences are sciences concerned with the study of living organisms and their organization, life processes, and relationships to each other and their environment. Physical Sciences are the areas of sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects.  It is the study of the physical properties of the world around you.  Studies in the physical sciences advances knowledge of the forces and principles that give order to the natural world and are the foundation for engineering, technology, medicine, and all other sciences. Within the Sciences at W&L, there are three interdisciplinary programs, two curriculum-based programs and one grant initiative.  Environmental Studies and Neuroscience involve complementary, cross-departmental studies to provide the appropriate context and research experiences to develop disciplinary expertise in these fields of study.  The Howard Hughes Medical Institute Initiative provides funds for facilities and courses which increase accessibility of science studies to a broader academic audience as well as retain more students in STEM areas.

Graduates will be prepared for life-long learning, personal achievement, responsible leadership, service to others, and engaged citizenship in a global and diverse society. Distinctive Strengths Washington and Lee is one of the oldest and most distinguished liberal arts institutions in the country. Liberal arts education expands our horizons, develops our capacities, and deepens our humanity. The alumni of W&L are living proof that the pursuit of one's intellectual interests for their own sake is an exceptional foundation for accomplishment in any arena and for making significant contributions to society. Our most valuable asset is the quality of our community. Great liberal arts education depends upon the talent, dedication, and diversity that characterize our students, faculty, and staff. The Honor System asks and expects each student to take personal responsibility for being worthy of the community's trust. Such universal trustworthiness fosters mutual respect and civility, and forges powerful bonds between the members of the extended Washington and Lee family. Our faculty are devoted teachers and scholars who uphold the highest academic standards and take a personal interest in the lives of their students. Our staff take pride in knowing that each individual makes important contributions to the success of the university. Our alumni are extraordinarily loyal and generous to their alma mater. W&L's curriculum reflects an abiding spirit of innovation and public service, and the courage to be different within higher education. We are distinguished from other top liberal arts colleges in virtue of having an accredited undergraduate school of commerce and a venerable law school. Each of our three academic units is strengthened by its meaningful collaborations with the others, all in the service of our joint university mission. Washington and Lee is committed to institutional citizenship. We regard liberal arts education as an important public good, of value not only to our students and alumni, but also to the larger communities in which we live. W&L strives to make a positive difference in Lexington, Rockbridge County, and beyond. Washington and Lee is a modern university located on a campus of great natural beauty and national significance. The Shenandoah Valley is a glorious setting in which to live, work, and play. Our built environment\u00a0\u2014\u00a0from the ruins of Liberty Hall to the Colonnade, University Chapel, Doremus Gymnasium, and the Ruscio Center for Global Learning\u00a0\u2014 reminds us that the history of W&L spans the four centuries of our country. We take inspiration from the fact that so many generations have come before us, walking these same hills and bricks, sharing our devotion to liberal arts education. We are justifiably proud of our distinctions, but never complacent. One of our most enduring strengths is the spirit encapsulated in our motto: non incautus futuri\u00a0\u2014 not unmindful of the future\u00a0\u2014 which reflects our commitment to self-examination, to asking how we can be true to ourselves while also getting better, to asking how we can contribute even more to the world that awaits our students. It is in keeping with this spirit that we have developed this strategic plan. Vision Washington and Lee aspires to be a national model for liberal arts education in the 21st century. Our community of trust and civility, our distinctive curriculum, our commitment to institutional citizenship for the benefit of society, and our beautiful and historic campus, are a potent educational combination. I. Community Washington and Lee is a welcoming, friendly, and mutually supportive community. Our students, faculty, and staff prize the trusting, respectful, and civil environment on our campus. We are united by our mission, diverse in our thinking, perspectives, and interests, and devoted to each other and to W&L. Sustain our distinguishing values, academic and professional excellence, and intellectual diversity Increase the racial, socioeconomic, and international diversity of our students, faculty, and staff Include, engage, and connect all members of our community to W&L and each other The quality of our education is determined by the qualities of our people. We seek to recruit and retain students, faculty, and staff who are intelligent, honorable, curious, compassionate, and collaborative. Active participation in the deep exploration, thoughtful consideration, and respectful debate of a wide range of ideas is at the heart of what we do. The quality of our education is also determined by the diversity of perspectives in our classrooms, living spaces, performance halls, and athletic arenas. Attracting talented people from all demographic groups is critical to our ability to provide the finest possible education. Competing successfully for the most talented students, faculty, and staff will strengthen our national reputation, which will assist our efforts to build the highest quality educational community. Creating a more diverse community at W&L is also essential to fulfilling our stated mission of preparing students for personal achievement, responsible leadership, and engaged citizenship in a global and diverse society. The 21st century calls upon all of us to appreciate the value of diverse experiences, and to discover and create ways to draw upon our differences for the common good. Employers recognize the value of these skills and increasingly prioritize recruiting on campuses that offer diverse pools of prospective job candidates. Cultivating the potential of students, faculty, and staff from all backgrounds is a powerful form of institutional citizenship, through which W&L can make a significant contribution to the future of our increasingly diverse country. Quality liberal education overcomes mutual misunderstanding, unites people across their differences, and provides all with the opportunity for success. Each member of our community must be able to thrive at Washington and Lee. As we become increasingly diverse, we must work to ensure that all students, faculty, and staff are fully included and engaged in university life. This is critical not only to the success of each individual, but also to sustaining the quality of our community, which depends upon a shared feeling of attachment to W&L. 1. Need-Blind Undergraduate Admissions Admit the strongest applicants, regardless of family financial circumstances 2. \"Full W&L Experience\" for every W&L student Eliminate financial barriers to curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular participation Offer high-quality residential, dining, and social options for all students 3. National Talent Outreach Communicate W&L's values and opportunities to prospective students, faculty, and staff Recruit deep and diverse applicant pools for undergraduate and law school admission Recruit deep and diverse applicant pools for faculty and staff positions Involve athletics and the arts in recruiting excellent students from all backgrounds to W&L 4. Law School Scholarships Develop a signature program to attract the best law students to W&L 5. Community Building and Support Deepen student connections to W&L through the Office of Inclusion and Engagement Expand athletic and recreational opportunities: varsity softball, outing club, club sports Foster student well-being with Health and Counseling resources Enhance student outcomes with Career and Professional Development resources Retain faculty and staff with opportunities for personal and professional development II. Curriculum Washington and Lee has been a leader for 150 years in combining the liberal arts, pre-professional education, and public service. This combination advances our mission, which commits us to developing the intellect and character of our students with the aim of preparing them to succeed in the personal, professional, and civic arenas. It is also reflected in our curricular structure: the College; the Williams School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics; and the School of Law. W&L is dedicated to the highest-quality teaching across the university. We offer small classes taught by skilled faculty who are devoted to helping students cultivate their considerable potential. Classroom teaching is supplemented by high-impact opportunities for participation in research, experiential learning, study abroad, internships, and legal clinics. Invest in 21st-century liberal arts education Build upon our distinctive curricular structure Support innovative teaching and student success Providing an outstanding liberal arts education is the core of our mission. The liberal arts have timeless value, developing the intellectual abilities and personal traits that will serve students well for the rest of their lives. We must continue to invest in traditional disciplines, while also embracing the 21st-century evolution of liberal education, which involves interdisciplinary inquiry, new modes of teaching, and rapidly changing technology. Doing so is critical to maintaining our position as one of the preeminent institutions of higher education in the country. It is also beneficial to the prospects of our students, since savvy employers value people with the skills and habits of mind cultivated by deep engagement with the liberal arts. W&L has been distinguished since the 19th century by its integration of explicitly pre-professional subjects with the liberal arts. This is a competitive advantage today, when prospective students and parents are often focused on the relationship between college education and career opportunities. Our curricular structure, and the resources of our law school, allow us to offer courses and majors that are unavailable at other top liberal arts colleges. This distinction can help us attract talented students to W&L, where we should ensure that every student, no matter his or her major, receives an excellent liberal education. Faculty members often spend decades teaching at W&L. Making available professional development opportunities so that our teachers can continue to hone their craft over the course of their careers is a critical investment in our mission. We must also ensure that our students have ready access to the academic resources they need to benefit fully from all that a W&L education has to offer. 1. Liberal Arts Education Advocate robustly and publicly for the value of the liberal arts Ensure our curriculum provides all students a liberal education in the service of our mission 2. STEM Programs Support 21st-century science teaching and research needs 3. Interdisciplinary Programs Strengthen interdisciplinary education 4. Williams School Opportunities Expand offerings for non-majors in the Williams School 5. Legal Studies Program Develop an undergraduate legal studies program involving all three academic units 6. Educational Excellence Provide comprehensive academic support services for students Offer opportunities for ongoing pedagogical development for faculty III. Citizenship Washington and Lee is civic-minded and forward-looking. Guided by its motto\u00a0\u2014\u00a0non incautus futuri\u00a0\u2014 the institution has always asked, at each moment in its long history, how it can best contribute not only to the success of its own students, but also to the nation and the world in which they will live. Liberty Hall Academy provided education on the frontier as the newly created United States began its westward expansion. Washington College contributed to the reconciliation and rebuilding of the country as it sought to recover from the devastation wrought by the Civil War. Washington and Lee University continues to embrace institutional citizenship in many forms. The Shepherd Program prepares students to work with disadvantaged communities to address the problems associated with poverty. The Environmental Studies Program provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the causes, consequences, and solutions to environmental problems, and offers associated service-learning opportunities. The Center for International Education guides students as they chart their paths toward becoming engaged citizens in a global and diverse society. The Connolly Center for Entrepreneurship annually hosts a vibrant social impact summit. The Mudd Center for Ethics involves students and faculty from all three schools at W&L in addressing significant issues of public and professional ethics. The Law School's legal clinics and externships help meet the need for legal assistance in the region and enable students to develop client contact and advocacy skills. The Office of Community-Based Learning coordinates efforts across the university to integrate academic study and civic engagement with community partners. Offer programs designed to foster responsible leadership, service to others, and civic engagement Teach and present our institutional history as comprehensively and accurately as possible Steward our resources responsibly The cultivation of engaged citizenship is essential to our mission. We aim to help students become not only personally successful, but also thoughtful difference-makers in their communities. Washington and Lee asks no less of itself institutionally. We achieve our largest social impact through the education of our students. By teaching thousands of young people to engage, to serve, and to lead, we indirectly benefit communities all over the world. Such teaching also benefits local partners directly, as our students work with them in the course of their studies at W&L. Washington and Lee also makes a difference by virtue of our own institutional contributions to the world beyond our campus. At this particular moment, we have an opportunity to set a national example for how an educational institution examines, teaches, and presents its history. We will do so honestly and thoughtfully, for the benefit of the present and future members of our community, as well as the citizens of our country. Stewarding our resources responsibly enables us to carry out our mission more efficiently and reduce our environmental impacts. Doing so also provides opportunities to help others learn how to evaluate the environmental implications of projects in their own communities. 1. Leadership, Service, and Civic Engagement Invest in curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular programs that foster these traits 2. Institutional History Present our history to internal and external constituencies, comprehensively and accurately Explore partnerships with related historical museums and sites 3. Environmental Stewardship Develop and implement an action plan to meet our climate commitments Continue building to LEED-certified standards Identify and prioritize opportunities to reduce resource consumption and waste IV. Campus Washington and Lee is fortunate to be located in the city of Lexington, surrounded by Rockbridge County, at the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The communities of which we are a part, and the natural setting that sustains us all, provide abundant and appealing opportunities for living, learning, and working. Washington and Lee has taken care to preserve the historic character of our campus, which serves as a daily reminder that our fundamental work\u00a0\u2014 providing an education that prepares young people for personal achievement and public service\u00a0\u2014 has been conducted here since the 18th century. We carry on this work today, in buildings that are national historic landmarks, and in modern facilities that serve the distinctive needs of teaching and learning in the 21st century. Our campus physically reflects the enduring value of liberal arts education and serves as a rich site for teaching students about American history and the natural world. Provide first-rate facilities that support our mission Take full educational advantage of our natural setting and historic campus Our campus should attract people to W&L, support their work, and enrich their lives. Prospective students, faculty, and staff should be able to perceive the distinctive opportunities afforded by studying, teaching, and working at Washington and Lee. Our residence halls, dining facilities, classrooms, labs, libraries, and performance spaces constitute an environment in which we strive to offer education of the highest caliber. Our natural and historic setting, which distinguishes W&L from other colleges and universities, should be presented in ways that make its appeal evident to prospective members of the community. 1. Admissions and Financial Aid Center Introduce prospective students to the quality, affordability, and distinctions of W&L 2. Science Center Expand and upgrade to support 21st-century teaching and research 3. Williams School Expand and upgrade facilities to support teaching, learning, and conferencing needs 4.

We want students to feel welcome, be aware of and likely to use resources, and develop skills intellectually, emotionally, and socially. W&L is committed to the recruitment and retention of a broad, inclusive student body, faculty and administration who represent a wide range of interests, abilities and cultures. W&L offers students the opportunity to join hundreds of student organizations and attend speakers, concerts, movies, and other events throughout the year so that your life on campus is never dull. College can be a big adjustment, and at W&L, we believe that there is a direct connection between what happens in and beyond the classroom. Beginning with the First-Year Program, we offer the guidance, resources and support to help students succeed on both academic and personal levels. Living in campus residence halls is an important part of every W&L undergraduate student's experience.  All first-years, sophomores, and juniors live in University housing, in a variety of group settings including traditional residence halls, apartments, townhouses, and themed housing.  Rising seniors typically secure living arrangements off-campus, however a limited number or rooms are usually available for seniors who wish to remain on campus. Law students are not eligible for campus housing. Dining Services offers a full board meal plan for first-year students, who take the majority of their meals in the Marketplace, W&L's main dining hall. Upper-division students have several meal plan options which allow them to take their meals in any of the three campus dining facilities, as well as in fraternity/sorority housing and off campus. The Career and Professional Development Center complements the educational experience of students by providing the guidance and resources needed to develop and implement their academic and career plans. Its comprehensive services emphasize collaborative relationships with employers, alumni, faculty, peer institutions and the W&L community. The Student Health Center at Washington and Lee University includes three departments to help students, be it counseling or providing information about health issues. The Office of Public Safety provides a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff and visitors to the University community. The community of trust created by Washington and Lee's student-run Honor System is one of the hallmarks of student life. W&L students hold each other accountable for honorable behavior, character and integrity, actively participating in the governance of student conduct through six bodies. Contact Information Sidney S.

RTEC is a partnership between Washington and Lee University and Southern Virginia University. The value and advantages of the Consortium rest on several factors: proximity and program identity opportunities for a richer program through institutional collaboration ability to meet licensure areas where teacher shortages exist professional development and partnering with local schools Collaboration among the two schools offers a number of strengths. It supplements the capacity of both education departments to create a robust program that offers more courses, more frequently. Because of the consortium, students will be better positioned to schedule and take the courses they need to complete their licensure requirements. Clearly, one of the major strengths of this collaboration is the diversity of knowledge, skills and values in the two teacher education departments that complement and reinforce each other. While each shares a common perspective as small liberal arts colleges, each also has a unique mission and attracts students with different interests and backgrounds. The consortium recognizes the complexity this generates, but values the opportunity for students to engage in a collaborative program where they can learn from each other. This collaborative structure produces a critical mass of diverse students for each education course that enriches class discussions and collaborative projects. Feature Stories Loading...

{"note": "General Counsel About Us Staff Directory Answer Center Code of Policies Legal Notices Departmental Telecommunications Policy Approved By: Chief Technology Officer; Vice President for Finance and Administration / Treasurer Issued: 12/6/2007 Revised: 1/1/2020 Responsible Office: Telecommunications Introduction This policy sets forth rules governing use of all University-provided telecommunications devices. Telecommunications services are administered by the University Telecommunications Office. This policy applies to all faculty, staff, and student-workers at the University who use telecommunication services and devices that are either owned, paid for, or reimbursed through stipend, by the University, including (but not limited to) traditional telephones, fax machines, pagers, cellular phones, and wireless personal digital devices. This policy also governs use of voice-mail, but does not govern e-mail communications. Definitions Business Use - use of a \"telecommunications device\" in a manner that is consistent with and furthers the missions and operations of the University. Personal Call - use of a \"telecommunications device\" that does not qualify as a \"business call.\" Local Call - a call within \"the local calling area\" and for which no additional fee is charged. Long-Distance Call - a call that incurs an additional fee for being outside the \"local calling area\" of an applicable telecommunications service plan. Portable Telecommunication Device - any cell phone, personal digital assistant, pager, or other similar device. Policy Any business calls not otherwise prohibited by this policy are acceptable. Personal calls are acceptable to the extent that they: 1) are reasonable in both duration and frequency; 2) comply with other applicable restrictions of this policy; 3) do not interfere with the individual's performance of work responsibilities (except in the case of a personal emergency); and 4) are reimbursed to the University where applicable under this policy. The following uses are generally prohibited, with exceptions only as specifically noted: Third-Party BillingCalls made from a non-University phone and charged to the University, and collect calls, except in the case of emergency. Operator-Assisted CallsOperator-Assisted calls in any instance in which the call can be made at a later time after the relevant information is obtained for free (e.g. through a phonebook, the internet, etc.). If a call must be made immediately, and there is no other way to obtain the information, operator-assistance (a.k.a. \"Information\") may be used. Operator-assisted personal calls must be specifically identified on the monthly bill and reimbursed to the University. Threatening/Offensive CallsThreatening and/or offensive calls involving any University Telecommunications Device. Such calls may also constitute a violation of other applicable University policies. Threatening and/or offensive calls should be reported immediately to Public Safety. If line-monitoring is needed, Public Safety will contact the Telecommunications Office. Employees are responsible for maintaining voice-mail greetings and for checking voice-mail messages on any University telecommunications device on which such voice-mail is equipped. If an employee expects to be out of the office for an extended period of time, (s)he should modify the voice-mail greeting accordingly. In the event of an unexpected and prolonged absence, the employee (or department head, if the employee is unable to do so) should contact the Telecommunications Manager in writing to arrange for a modified voice-mail greeting. Discontinuance of University-Provided Portable Telecommunications Devices and StipendsEffective January 1, 2020, the University will no longer provide portable telecommunications devices or service stipends to employees.\u00a0 However, employees currently receiving a portable telecommunications device or stipend will remain eligible for the device or stipend until such time as they terminate employment with the University or change positions to a position not already receiving a device or stipend, whichever comes first. Employees Receiving a Stipend or Portable Telecommunications Device and University-Contracted Service as of January 1, 2020The following plan options provisions specifically apply to any University employee whose job requires use of a portable telecommunications device and who is, as of January 1, 2020, receiving a stipend or University-owned and managed device:a. University-Contracted ServicePrior to January 1, 2020, the University has contracted for the provision of portable telecommunications service and devices to: (1) all senior administrators; and (2) other qualifying employees who chose this option. All related bills are sent directly to the University, and employees may receive assistance for any service/device issues from the University Telecommunications Office.Any employee who - for personal reasons - terminates his/her existing University-Contracted Service before the expiration of the current service contract will no longer be eligible for University-Contracted Service or a stipend.The value of the portable telecommunications service is reported on applicable tax and payroll documents as taxable fringe benefit income to the employee at the rate paid by the University.b. Portable Telecommunications StipendQualifying employees who chose this option receive a monthly stipend to be used toward payment of their own portable telecommunications service.

The amount of all stipends issued is reported on tax documents as taxable income to the employee.The amount of the monthly stipends is subject to review at any time by the University, and may be canceled or reduced as the University deems appropriate. SafetyEmployees should not use portable telecommunications devices when operating a motor vehicle.

Intuitive functionality, more reliable access to data, and marked improvement in efficiencies were all critical components to selecting Workday as W&L\u2019s next solution. Now, faculty, staff and students have all seen first-hand the system upgrades following HCM/Finance go-live in September of 2020 and launch of the student component in March of 2022. As we near the end of the implementation-phase of this multi-year project, it now becomes necessary to decommission Colleague, Self-Service and Entrinsik Informer. The first step will involve removing login access for users. While most of the data associated with the legacy systems has been moved into Workday, there are instances where historical data will be maintained for a number of years to complete the transition. October 3rd \u2013 Login Access Expires for Colleague and Self-Service Starting on Monday, October 3rd, faculty, staff and students will no longer have login access to Colleague and Self-Service. Most business process functions previously accessed in the legacy systems will now be found in Workday. October 14th \u2013 Login Access Expires for Entrinsik Informer Starting on Friday, October 14th, faculty, staff and students will no longer have login access to Entrinsik Informer. Functional access to most reports and university data will now be found in Workday. Should you have any questions about this transition, please contact the ITS Helpdesk at X4357 or help@wlu.edu.

The drill, part of our ongoing emergency preparedness program, is intended to simulate an emergency situation, providing the university and local first responders an opportunity to both practice and evaluate their response to a campus emergency. For an extended period this morning, those on or near campus may notice an increased presence of law enforcement officials and emergency vehicles in the area, as well as a number of actors\u2014including students\u2014portraying various roles in the simulated situation. Those in close proximity may also hear sounds related to the drill, such as loud voices, police and EMS activity, and simulated gunfire. We will also be testing our communications systems and response during an emergency, so you will receive General Alerts before, during and after the drill, and may see posts about the simulated incident on W&L's social media channels. These will be test messages only, preceded by \"THIS IS A DRILL,\" so you will not be expected to shelter in place should the test messages call for that. We will also send a final alert to let you know when the drill has been completed. Please avoid the area where the drill is taking place--in the space between Huntley Hall and Graham-Lees dorm--for the duration of the drill. As a reminder, in the event the live drill is a cause for distress for any members of the campus community, we have resources available through University Counseling for our students, and the Carilion Employee Assistance Program for faculty and staff."}
